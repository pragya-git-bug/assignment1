Answer1. A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data to perform various tasks according to a set of instructions called a program. It can store, retrieve, and process data, and it can perform a wide range of functions depending on the software and hardware it is equipped with.

Answer2. RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that is used to store data that is actively being used and processed by a computer or other digital devices. Unlike storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, which retain data even when the power is turned off, RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the power is cut.

Answer3. In a computer, data is stored in various types of storage devices. The primary types of storage devices include:

Hard Disk Drives (HDD): These are magnetic storage devices that use rapidly rotating disks (platters) to store and retrieve data. They are commonly used for long-term storage of large amounts of data.

Answer4.Keyboard.

Answer5.Output devices are peripherals or devices that receive data from a computer or another device and present or display the information in a human-readable form. They allow users to interact with and interpret the output generated by the computer. Common examples of output devices include:

Monitor/Display: Displays visual information such as text, graphics, and videos.

Printer: Produces a hard copy of documents, images, or other digital content on paper.

Speakers: Output audio signals, allowing users to hear sounds, music, and other auditory information.

Answer6. Mouse.

Answer7.Computers typically understand machine language or binary code directly, which is a series of 0s and 1s. This is the lowest-level programming language and is specific to the computer's architecture.

Answer8. Input devices are devices that allow users to input data and commands into a computer or other electronic devices. These devices enable communication between the user and the computer by converting physical actions or information into digital signals that the computer can understand. Here are some common types of input devices:

Keyboard: A keyboard is a common input device that allows users to input alphanumeric characters, numbers, and special symbols by pressing keys.

Mouse: A mouse is a pointing device that allows users to move a cursor on the screen and interact with graphical user interfaces. It typically has buttons that can be clicked to perform various actions.
